            "content_text": "Antfood is a creative audio studio with offices in Brooklyn, Amsterdam, and S√£o Paulo.We are all about Antfood‚Äôs website, which is built with Siteleaf. In particular, their loading animations inject a touch of humor to the site, which transforms a potentially boring wait into a moment of joy. This playful style translates directly into their work.It‚Äôs one of the only portfolios where exploring and finding hidden gems feels like an exciting quest and a considered part of the user journey, rather than an afterthought. This thoughtfulness is perhaps unsurprising as the site was designed by XXIX, who make amazing treats for the internet.We chatted with Wilson Brown, ECD and Partner at Antfood, about curiosity, collaboration, and the year ahead.Can you tell me about Antfood, and how you got to where you are now?We started Antfood in 2007 and have grown slowly from there. I felt we had drive and some basic talent, but truthfully we were kids with little experience, no connections and zero capital. We got to where we are now by focusing on making great work and seeking out great collaborators, colleagues and projects.I feel very grateful for the successes that we‚Äôve had, and I‚Äôm proud of the reputation that we‚Äôve built, but it was achieved very slowly, by taking little steps to improve our craft, team, physical studio, instruments, equipment, and over the years our portfolio. Even now, we‚Äôre still trying to do the same thing every day, to take on new challenges, hone our craft and do things that no one has done before ‚Äî or at least we haven‚Äôt tried yet!You‚Äôve collaborated with some fantastic companies, are there any pieces of work that you continue to look back on and think ‚Äòdamn, that‚Äôs great‚Äô?Thanks for the kind words. We take pride in building relationships and actively try to find like-minded creative collaborators, who we can help elevate their craft, and they can help elevate ours. Buck Design has been a great collaborator over the years, and we‚Äôve worked together on the number of pieces together since 2009, that have been seminal for Antfood regarding process and creative, and I hope the same is true for Buck too!I rarely look back at old work on a day-to-day basis, but often when we‚Äôre putting together talks for conferences or festivals, revamping our website or social presence, or just reflecting on our mission and values past and present, I love seeing the work we‚Äôve done over the years. Sometimes these are big portfolio pieces, and sometimes they are forgotten or ignored projects, and I love seeing tiny strokes of genius, humor and artistry within the more generic projects, that you don‚Äôt necessarily appreciate at the time when you‚Äôre in the thick of production, approvals, and delivery.Pedro and I are putting together a talk for a conference in Amsterdam next week, and I came across a couple of pieces that I had pushed to the back of my mind, but still love Freebord (2009), Sundance (2010), AICP (2017). Also, a perennial favorite, that was played out back in 2012, but I still I love going back to is our deconstructed, and dingy Kafka-esque piece with Buck, Metamorphosis for Good Books.What does your creative process look like?In composition, I try to vary my process, to ensure that I‚Äôm coming up with new and different ideas sounds, harmonies and textures. That can influence what kind of instruments or structural form I begin with, and what I deem the central elements of the composition.For example, sometimes I‚Äôll start with a beat or a harmonic framework and build everything up around that, other times I‚Äôll start with the opinion, the voice or even a more abstract point of view and use what musical and arrangement tools I need to convey that idea best. Similarly, there are times where I start with a specific skeleton and fill it in, or other times I will start with more of an open palette and experiment until I find something that seems strong enough to inspire the rest of the compositional elements to fall into place around it.More broadly speaking, whether I‚Äôm composing music and sound design, making creative decisions regarding the broader scope of projects, selling through concepts and ideas, or even helping to steer our company‚Äôs entrepreneurial vision.I try to do simultaneously define some kind of North Star or guiding principle, that I can always go back and ask ‚Äúare we getting closer to the goal, are we on track?‚Äù but at the same time, to encourage and welcome dissent, to stay curious and open-minded, and realize we often come across better solutions and better questions then we had in mind when we started the process.With all that said, I try to be pragmatic, and diligent at stepping forward rather than backward or sideways to actually get things done.When was the last time you were afraid of making a work-related decision?I‚Äôm often afraid of work-related decisions. These can range from simple production questions like, ‚Äúshould I put a guitar in this track?‚Äù, to broader business decisions like personnel, visions for the future of the studio, and what kind of projects we should work on. But these are fears with a lowercase ‚Äòf‚Äô, and I think fear is an important driving factor in my creative work.As artists, we often are consumed by self-doubt and question our choices. I think overcoming these fears, embracing them or just putting your head down and pushing through them, is what makes us better artists and stronger human beings, and gives our life and our work meaning.If I only worked on projects that were straightforward and didn‚Äôt require the need to doubt decisions, I‚Äôd likely just be making mindless and generic work, and I don‚Äôt think that would be a substantive professional existence. So, while excessive fear can be crippling, or at least counterproductive, personally I think it‚Äôs important to embrace and push through, rather than brushing it under the rug or avoiding it entirely.How do you stay curious?That‚Äôs a great question and a very important concept to me. Especially as we grow up, get consumed by work, routine, families, and the mundane aspects of modern life.I try to seek out new music, art and experience, that open my mind to different emotions, ideas, thought processes, and techniques. First, I try to keep an open mind and try new things, especially things that scare you or take you out of your comfort zone. Second, maintaining an interesting and diverse group of peers, that bring different perspectives and taste to help broaden my awareness of Art, culture and more. Finally, more specific to my work composing music and crafting sound, I find that using particular tools and techniques, or setting limits on how to structure the creative process, helps keep me curious by diving into new areas that I might overlook or remain ignorant of.I have the great luxury of working in a studio where we have all kinds of tools and toys, and I think when you have a lot of things at your fingertips, you can revert to common tricks and techniques that you‚Äôve used before.  While this is one of the luxuries of having all kinds of fun gear and instruments, it‚Äôs also important to place limitations on yourself sometime so you can actually dive into a particular instrument or sound and find something new.What are you most excited about looking at the year ahead?First, we had a great year in 2018, we worked hard on building solid systems, and a fantastic team, so that we could focus on what we do best - the work. We celebrated our 10-year anniversary with all three studios (New York, S√£o Paulo and Amsterdam) for a week in Mexico. There, we spent a lot of time patting ourselves on the back for making it this far, but focusing on about what the next 1/3/5/10 years will look like for Antfood and what we can do to remain relevant as well as continue to get better over the coming decade.Specifically for 2019, we are developing a couple of new means of production, both for the AR/VR space, and for nonlinear games and experiences, but also for mixing custom, multi-channel audio in physical spaces. We‚Äôve developed some neat tools for playing with sound and space, and I‚Äôm hoping we can convince some clients and collaborators to help us bring them to a larger audience!I‚Äôm looking forward to our amazing team to continuing to grow and evolve and be able to take on more unique projects and challenges. We‚Äôre building a new (and hopefully) fresh platform based on machine learning to help organize and repurpose our back catalog of work. Finally, I hope we have the chance to continue working with our favorite people and meet some new ones to craft amazing audio work that moves people and gives some meaning to those who helped create it!See more of Antfood‚Äôs work at antfood.com on Instagram, Twitter, and Vimeo.",

We take pride in building relationships and actively try to find like-minded creative collaborators, who we can help elevate their craft, and they can help elevate ours. <a href=\"http://buck.tv/#/\">Buck Design</a> has been a great collaborator over the years, and we‚Äôve worked together on the number of pieces together since 2009, that have been seminal for Antfood regarding process and creative, and I hope the same is true for Buck too!</p><p>I rarely look back at old work on a day-to-day basis, but often when we‚Äôre putting together talks for conferences or festivals, revamping our website or social presence, or just reflecting on our mission and values past and present, I love seeing the work we‚Äôve done over the years. Sometimes these are big portfolio pieces, and sometimes they are forgotten or ignored projects, and I love seeing tiny strokes of genius, humor and artistry within the more generic projects, that you don‚Äôt necessarily appreciate at the time when you‚Äôre in the thick of production, approvals, and delivery.</p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/38386297?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p>Pedro and I are putting together a talk for a conference in Amsterdam next week, and I came across a couple of pieces that I had pushed to the back of my mind, but still love <a href=\"https://www.antfood.com/load/#freebord-8-bit\"><em>Freebord</em></a> (2009), <a href=\"https://www.antfood.com/load/#come-together\"><em>Sundance</em></a> (2010), <a href=\"https://www.antfood.com/load/#2017-show-opening-titles\"><em>AICP</em></a> (2017). Also, a perennial favorite, that was played out back in 2012, but I still I love going back to is our deconstructed, and dingy Kafka-esque piece with Buck, <em><a href=\"https://www.antfood.com/load/#good-books-metamorphosis\">Metamorphosis</a></em> for Good Books.</p><h3 id=\"what-does-your-creative-process-look-like\">What does your creative process look like?</h3><p>In composition, I try to vary my process, to ensure that I‚Äôm coming up with new and different ideas sounds, harmonies and textures. That can influence what kind of instruments or structural form I begin with, and what I deem the central elements of the composition.</p><p>For example, sometimes I‚Äôll start with a beat or a harmonic framework and build everything up around that, other times I‚Äôll start with the opinion, the voice or even a more abstract point of view and use what musical and arrangement tools I need to convey that idea best. Similarly, there are times where I start with a specific skeleton and fill it in, or other times I will start with more of an open palette and experiment until I find something that seems strong enough to inspire the rest of the compositional elements to fall into place around it.</p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/260121225?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p>More broadly speaking, whether I‚Äôm composing music and sound design, making creative decisions regarding the broader scope of projects, selling through concepts and ideas, or even helping to steer our company‚Äôs entrepreneurial vision.</p><p>I try to do simultaneously define some kind of North Star or guiding principle, that I can always go back and ask ‚Äúare we getting closer to the goal, are we on track?‚Äù but at the same time, to encourage and welcome dissent, to stay curious and open-minded, and realize we often come across better solutions and better questions then we had in mind when we started the process.</p><p>With all that said, I try to be pragmatic, and diligent at stepping forward rather than backward or sideways to actually get things done.</p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/220858720?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><h3 id=\"when-was-the-last-time-you-were-afraid-of-making-a-work-related-decision\">When was the last time you were afraid of making a work-related decision?</h3><p>I‚Äôm often afraid of work-related decisions. These can range from simple production questions like, ‚Äúshould I put a guitar in this track?‚Äù, to broader business decisions like personnel, visions for the future of the studio, and what kind of projects we should work on. But these are fears with a lowercase ‚Äòf‚Äô, and I think fear is an important driving factor in my creative work.</p><p>As artists, we often are consumed by self-doubt and question our choices. I think overcoming these fears, embracing them or just putting your head down and pushing through them, is what makes us better artists and stronger human beings, and gives our life and our work meaning.</p><p>If I only worked on projects that were straightforward and didn‚Äôt require the need to doubt decisions, I‚Äôd likely just be making mindless and generic work, and I don‚Äôt think that would be a substantive professional existence. So, while excessive fear can be crippling, or at least counterproductive, personally I think it‚Äôs important to embrace and push through, rather than brushing it under the rug or avoiding it entirely.</p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/285113069?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><h3 id=\"how-do-you-stay-curious\">How do you stay curious?</h3><p>That‚Äôs a great question and a very important concept to me. Especially as we grow up, get consumed by work, routine, families, and the mundane aspects of modern life.</p><p>I try to seek out new music, art and experience, that open my mind to different emotions, ideas, thought processes, and techniques. First, I try to keep an open mind and try new things, especially things that scare you or take you out of your comfort zone. Second, maintaining an interesting and diverse group of peers, that bring different perspectives and taste to help broaden my awareness of Art, culture and more. Finally, more specific to my work composing music and crafting sound, I find that using particular tools and techniques, or setting limits on how to structure the creative process, helps keep me curious by diving into new areas that I might overlook or remain ignorant of.</p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/9499310?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p>I have the great luxury of working in a studio where we have all kinds of tools and toys, and I think when you have a lot of things at your fingertips, you can revert to common tricks and techniques that you‚Äôve used before.  While this is one of the luxuries of having all kinds of fun gear and instruments, it‚Äôs also important to place limitations on yourself sometime so you can actually dive into a particular instrument or sound and find something new.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-you-most-excited-about-looking-at-the-year-ahead\">What are you most excited about looking at the year ahead?</h3><p>First, we had a great year in 2018, we worked hard on building solid systems, and a fantastic team, so that we could focus on what we do best - the work. We celebrated our 10-year anniversary with all three studios (New York, S√£o Paulo and Amsterdam) for a week in Mexico. There, we spent a lot of time patting ourselves on the back for making it this far, but focusing on about what the next 1/3/5/10 years will look like for Antfood and what we can do to remain relevant as well as continue to get better over the coming decade.</p><p>Specifically for 2019, we are developing a couple of new means of production, both for the AR/VR space, and for nonlinear games and experiences, but also for mixing custom, multi-channel audio in physical spaces. We‚Äôve developed some neat tools for playing with sound and space, and I‚Äôm hoping we can convince some clients and collaborators to help us bring them to a larger audience!</p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/192041048?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p>I‚Äôm looking forward to our amazing team to continuing to grow and evolve and be able to take on more unique projects and challenges. We‚Äôre building a new (and hopefully) fresh platform based on machine learning to help organize and repurpose our back catalog of work. Finally, I hope we have the chance to continue working with our favorite people and meet some new ones to craft amazing audio work that moves people and gives some meaning to those who helped create it!</p><p><strong>See more of Antfood‚Äôs work at <a href=\"https://www.antfood.com/\">antfood.com</a> on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/antfood.music/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/antfood\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/antfood\">Vimeo</a>.</strong></p>",

            "content_text": "Watch Publishing a new blog post on VimeoIn this tutorial, we‚Äôll go through how to write and publish a new blog post. To get caught up on Familiarizing yourself with Siteleaf watch our previous video in Siteleaf for Content Managers and Creators.Writing a new blog postHead up to the sidebar and click on Posts, located in the content section of the sidebar. When you click on posts, you‚Äôll see something like this.To create a new post press the plus icon on the right side and it‚Äôll take you to a screen that looks like this.Start by typing your title up at the top.If you want to specify your URL, you can do that underneath the title, but if you leave it blank Siteleaf will do all the hard work for you and the slug (that‚Äôs the end of the URL) will be the title of the blogpost separated by hyphens.Having slugs that are readable by both humans and machines is good for SEO because it encourages users to click on the link as they already understand the content of the post. It also tells the web crawlers hanging out online what the main subject of the post is about, which will help generate traffic to your site. Read more about SEO with Jekyll and Siteleaf here.Underneath the URL in the big box is where you write the content for your post.Visual ModeFor the moment we will start in visual mode, and I‚Äôll go into detail later on about Markdown. Visual mode is currently in beta so sometimes it isn‚Äôt perfect, but it‚Äôs pretty smart and gets there 90% of the time.If you are used to seeing changes immediately in Microsoft Word and other similar programs this will be helpful for you.FormattingThe default setting for the text is paragraph, but you can use the toolbar at the top to style the text.HeadingsThere is a hierarchy of headings built in by your website‚Äôs designer. You may want to check with them for usage guidance. But in general, Heading 1 will be the biggest and most eye-catching, Heading 2 will be a bit smaller, a bit less eye-catching and Heading 3 will be smaller still and so on.To insert a heading, highlight the text that you want to become a heading, then choose from the drop down which type of heading you would like to apply to the text.BoldYou can add bold styling do this by highlighting and pressing the bold icon.ItalicsTo use italics highlight the text that you want to make italic, then choose the italic from the drop-down menu.QuotesYou can style a quote by highlighting the quotation and then pressing the quote icon.Code snippetIf you wanted to share a code snippet; style it by highlighting the text and then choose the code option from the drop-down.Code snippets can be helpful for technical blogs, and we use it a lot on our blog.  But if you‚Äôre writing about gardening, you can ignore this option.ListsYou can make a bullet point (or ‚Äúunordered‚Äù) list by clicking on the bullet list icon, and a numbered (or ‚Äúordered‚Äù) list by clicking on the numbered list icon next to it.Adding HyperlinksYou can add hyperlinks by highlighting the text that you want to become a link then clicking the link button in the toolbar.Then you‚Äôll see this input where you can add the URL to the website you‚Äôd like to direct people to. Once you have pasted that URL in and pressed ‚Äòok‚Äô the hyperlink will be created.Adding ImagesFinally, you will want to add some images to this post, so it‚Äôs not a big wall of text. First tap the image icon and this pop-up will appear.You can drag and drop your images to upload or choose the files from your computer. Also, you can click over to the ‚Äòexisting uploads‚Äô tab to discover all the images previously uploaded to Siteleaf.The first thing you will want to do is place your cursor where you‚Äôd like the image to be in your post. Then click on the image button again, and the pop-up will reappear. Then click over to the ‚Äòexisting uploads‚Äô tab and select the image you want to input by pressing insert underneath the image. Then you will see the image in the text.Adding EmojisSiteleaf will accept emojis in the same way that any other input field would. If you‚Äôre on Windows, you can choose the desired emoji from your touch keyboard. Or you can bring up an emoji keyboard on your mac by pressing command, control and the space bar at the same time and clicking on the desired emoji üöÄMarkdownIf you change the view to Markdown from the drop-down in the toolbar, you‚Äôll see that instead of generating a preview of the text styling we saw before there‚Äôs a lot of symbols.Markdown was created as a simple way for non-programmers to write in an easy-to-read format that could be converted directly into HTML. It uses very simple formatting to accomplish the same thing that HTML or Rich Text Formatting does, but thankfully it‚Äôs simpler than HTML because you don‚Äôt have to worry about opening and closing tags.One benefit of Markdown is that the formatting is embedded in the text, so when you copy the text from different programs the styling comes too. There‚Äôs nothing more frustrating than formatting something perfectly in a program like Word or Pages, just to lose all the formatting that you‚Äôve added when you copy and paste the text elsewhere.Another advantage for me is that Markdown uses punctuation and characters that I already know and use. Which means I‚Äôm not hunting around on the keyboard to try to remember where an umlaut is.There are lots of programs out there which help you write in Markdown as it‚Äôs such a versatile way of writing, you should check out Bear because it‚Äôs bear-y good or iA Writer which also works on Android as well as iOS.FormattingHeadingsWith markdown headings are done with the hash key, or as some of you might know it the pound key.So, # HEADLINE is a large header. ## HEADLINE would be a header that was a little smaller than the first, and ### HEADLINE would be a smaller header still.ItalicsFor italics, you want to put an asterisk or star either side of the word or phrase that you want to become *italic*.BoldTo make text bold put two asterisks or stars either side of the word or phrase you want to **bold**.QuoteTo turn your quotation into quote formatting put a &gt; greater than symbol at the start of the new line with the quote.Code snippetTo add a code snippet simply add a ` backtick either side of the text.ListsIf you want to make a numbered list (also known as an ordered list) simply start a new line and type 1. and then on the next line type 2.If you‚Äôd prefer to make a bullet point list (also known as an unordered list) just pop a dash on a new line each time you want a new bullet point.Adding HyperlinksTo add a link surround the word or phase in square brackets and then paste the link in parenthesis after, and boom you have a link.[text](www.intendedhyperlink.com)You can still use the link button in the toolbar for any of these functions if it‚Äôs easier for you, it isn‚Äôt one or the other.Adding ImagesInserting an image purely in Markdown is a little more tricky. Typically if I‚Äôm writing a draft somewhere outside of Siteleaf, I‚Äôll put something like ‚ÄòINSERT IMAGE HERE‚Äô in the text and then input the image the same way as described earlier on.However, it is achievable in Markdown and inserting an image works in the same way as adding a hyperlink. But you have to know the title that the image had when you uploaded it to Siteleaf. To insert an image in Markdown on a new line put:![](link to where the image lives on Siteleaf)The location of the image will be along the lines of /uploads/filenameBetween the square brackets, you need to add the image‚Äôs alt tag. Alt tags are used by screen readers, the browsers used by blind and visually impaired people, to tell them what the image shows. Also, bots use alt tags to understand the image, and this helps your SEO.There‚Äôs more on our blog about SEO with Jekyll and Siteleaf, which you should read for further SEO tips and best practices.Before you publishThere are a few last steps you‚Äôll want to do before making your post visible, and these will vary depending on how your site is set up.You may find metadata fields beneath the main text input. On our site, there‚Äôs a field where you can upload an image that will be displayed when you share the link online, which makes people more inclined to click on the link. Also, there is a field where you can post a description of the blog post. These act like a preview in the same way.These are called ‚Äòrich previews‚Äô and are particularly useful when posting links on social media like Facebook or in Slack channels as it gives your readers a flavor of what they will see before they click on the link, making them more inclined to click on and read further.I‚Äôd advise speaking to your Admin or Developer about the metadata fields on your site and the best way to use them. You can find more technical information on metadata here.Flight PanelOn the right on the main text input, you can see the flight panel.SaveThis button is where you save your changes. Should you forget to save the changes you‚Äôve made and click away from what you‚Äôre editing, Siteleaf will prompt you with a pop up to check if you want to leave these unsaved changes.Underneath there are three options for your post, either ‚ÄòDraft‚Äô, ‚ÄòHidden‚Äô or ‚ÄòVisible‚Äô.DraftDraft status is for posts that you are currently working on and shouldn‚Äôt yet be made public - or if your role is Writer, then this is how all of your posts will be saved before an Admin or Publisher makes them Visible. Learn more about roles on Siteleaf.HiddenHidden posts are exactly that - hidden. These can be useful if you‚Äôve written about your undying love for Chicago style pizza only to discover that you prefer New York style pizza and can‚Äôt have your previous opinion all over the internet. As a side note, all pizza is great.VisibleAll the posts that you‚Äôve written that you want the whole world to read should be set to visible.TagsWe like to use tags on our blog posts so that users can go through the tags to connect with other posts you tagged with the same tag in the past. For example, under the tag ‚Äòpizza‚Äô your readers can click through to see all your past pizza blog posts.This is great for UX because then someone can press on the tag, like ‚Äòannouncements‚Äô or ‚Äòpizza‚Äô, and see all the pizza posts on your site. This is also great for SEO. The more thoroughly you use tags, the easier it is for your readers and web crawlers to engage with your content across years of blog posts.CategoriesThese are very similar to tags, but with broader groupings. Tags and categories are similar, and their purpose is to sort your content to improve the usability of your site. Meaning when a user comes to your site, they can easily browse through your content by category or by tag rather than browsing chronologically, which is how blogs were initially set up.These work in much the same way as tags, and you can use them together. For example, you can use the category ‚Äòrecipe‚Äô whenever you talk about something you tried to cook, but you can use much more specific tags like ‚Äòpizza‚Äô, ‚Äòtacos‚Äô, or ‚Äòsalad‚Äô too.You should talk with your developer or site admin to see what is best for your website.DateThis is the date which the post was published. If you set it to a date in the future, it won‚Äôt automatically publish on that date unless you set up a scheduled or automatic publishing schedule.We recommend using Zapier for this task. With Zapier, and you can use it to integrate your Siteleaf site with lots of different applications like Trello, Twitter, Typeform and other apps not beginning with the letter T. Head to Zapier for more information.Publishing your postPublish this post by changing the post‚Äôs status to ‚Äòvisible‚Äô and hit save.As I mentioned in our last tutorial, I like to generate item preview before I publish a page, just to check that everything looks as I expected and that I haven‚Äôt accidentally added the wrong image or misspelled anything.Siteleaf generates a preview in this new tab. Once it‚Äôs ready you can check it over. If you‚Äôre happy with how it looks head back to Siteleaf‚Äôs tab to publish the post. Once you are confident everything looks great you can press ‚Äòpublish changes‚Äô in the top right corner.You will see that a loading animation takes over the blue bar at the top of Siteleaf. Once it‚Äôs published you can see the changes that you‚Äôve made on your website.Sometimes a new post might take a few minutes to show up because your website uses a cache. If this is the case you can access the direct URL and go ahead with sharing the post online.Stay TunedOur next video will explain step by step how to embed videos in Siteleaf - stay tuned to the blog for that soon!If there‚Äôs anything you would like for us to cover in our tutorials please get in touch on Twitter.",

There‚Äôs no code involved, so you can feel confident using Siteleaf.Familiarizing yourself with SiteleafWhen you log in to your account you‚Äôll see something like this.This is the Siteleaf Dashboard. The first thing you‚Äôll notice is the sidebar. Here are the elements of your website broken down into four sections.ContentThis section is organized by collections ‚Äî think of these as your main content buckets.This site has several collections, but you may only have a few options on yours. It depends on how your site has been set up.When looking at a new website I always click on each collection to familiarise myself with the content and then look at the published website to see how they relate.PagesA page is the most basic content type in Siteleaf - these might include your ‚Äòabout‚Äô page, or a ‚Äòcontact‚Äô page. See more about how to edit existing pages here.PostsAs a content creator, you‚Äôre most likely to want to know about the blog. Posts are connected to the blog page on your website.If your site does not have a blog, then feel free to ignore this section. You can click on the title of the post to edit.When you click through to the post you‚Äôll see up at the top is the title, you can click on it to edit it. Underneath is the post‚Äôs URL, and you can change the slug by clicking on the pencil icon. A slug is the editable part of your post‚Äôs URL.Here is the URL of the post:https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/seo-with-jekyll-siteleaf/This part is the slug:/seo-with-jekyll-siteleaf/Having slugs that are readable by both humans and machines is useful for SEO. Readable slugs encourage users to click on the link, because they already understand what the post is about. Also, you are signposting your post to the web crawlers. For more tips on SEO read our blog post about SEO with Jekyll and Siteleaf.Underneath is all the main body content of the page. You may also see inputs for metadata beneath the main body content, these will vary depending on how your site is set up. We‚Äôll go through metadata, tags, post visibility and more in our dedicated blog post video.FilesUploadsHere is where your uploaded images, videos and documents live. Click here to browse or search for items uploaded to Siteleaf.Siteleaf supports all document types; from jpegs to pdfs and mp4s. You can also add new items here by clicking ‚ÄòUpload file‚Äô.SiteThis is where all the data for your site‚Äôs source files live.As a content creator, you aren‚Äôt going to want to touch it. And, depending on your user role, you may not see it on your Siteleaf dashboard.UsersHere you can see who else has access to your website and what ‚Äòrole‚Äô they have.If you‚Äôre on a Team, Business, or Enterprise site plan, there are three different roles that users can be assigned. You can also add new users here by inputting their email address, assigning their role before pressing invite.RolesAdminThis role has full privileges which means that you can manage and publish all content. This role is great for people who are helping build the site, like a developer or designer. Admin allows users to upload theme files, change the site‚Äôs settings, and invite other collaborators.PublisherThis is similar to the admin role but publishers can‚Äôt access theme files or the site‚Äôs settings. Publishers can manage and publish pages, posts, and uploads, but you‚Äôre protected from accidentally breaking the site‚Äôs theme.WriterThis is the most limited role on Siteleaf. A Writer can only manage their own content, and any content that a Writer creates will default to ‚Äòdraft‚Äô status. This means that a Publisher or Admin must approve a writer‚Äôs content first before publishing it. This role is great for sites with many collaborators who only need access to add content, like a blog post.If you feel you haven‚Äôt got the right role for what you need to achieve on Siteleaf ask someone with the Admin role to change your settings.SettingsHere are the details of your site‚Äôs settings.Here you can edit settings or fields your developer may have created, like social media links or SEO descriptions. The options here will depend on your individual site.Editing existing pagesThis is a great place to start getting your hands dirty. First click on Pages underneath Content and you will see something like this:These are your website‚Äôs individual pages. You can click into each page by pressing on the title.Also, you can reorder the pages by dragging and dropping with the arrows. You can nest a page by sliding the item to the right until you see the outline indent underneath the page you want to become the parent.When you go into one of the pages you will see something like this:At the top is the page‚Äôs title, then following that is the URL of this particular page. You can edit this if you need by pressing on the pencil icon, like with the post earlier on.Below is the main body text. This is where you‚Äôd write all your content for the page. Siteleaf supports Markdown formatting. We will go into Markdown in detail in our dedicated blog post tutorial.Finally, below there may be different fields that your developer has created.

Or if you have a page that promotes your winter season you can hide that in the sweltering summer heat. If you are a Writer you will need to ask either an Admin or Publisher to make these changes for you.Click save to save the changes that you‚Äôve made. I personally like to check the edits before I publish. You can do that by pressing generate item preview.This will open up a new tab. Then you‚Äôll see that Siteleaf is taking the changes that you‚Äôve made and then updating the page. Once it‚Äôs generated the preview it‚Äôll show you a message which you can click on to refresh the page with your edits. When I‚Äôm happy with these changes we can go back to Siteleaf to publish.Publishing the pageYou can publish the changes by pressing the ‚ÄòPublish changes‚Äô button in the top right-hand corner.If you are a Writer on your site this button will not be visible. In this case, let a Publisher or Admin know when you‚Äôre ready to have your draft approved and then published.Publishing should be pretty quick, but sometimes it takes a bit longer with a bigger website. Once it‚Äôs published you can see the changes that you‚Äôve made on your website.Stay TunedOur next video will explain step by step how to publish a new blog post in Siteleaf.If there‚Äôs anything you would like for us to cover in our tutorials please get in touch on Twitter.",

There‚Äôs no code involved, so you can feel confident using Siteleaf.</p><h2 id=\"familiarizing-yourself-with-siteleaf\">Familiarizing yourself with Siteleaf</h2><p>When you log in to your account you‚Äôll see something like this.</p><p><img src=\"/uploads/Screen%20Shot%20Dashboard.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot Dashboard.png\" /></p><p>This is the Siteleaf Dashboard. The first thing you‚Äôll notice is the sidebar. Here are the elements of your website broken down into four sections.</p><h3 id=\"content\">Content</h3><p>This section is organized by collections ‚Äî think of these as your main content buckets.</p><p>This site has several collections, but you may only have a few options on yours. It depends on how your site has been set up.</p><p>When looking at a new website I always click on each collection to familiarise myself with the content and then look at the published website to see how they relate.</p><h4 id=\"pages\">Pages</h4><p>A page is the most basic content type in Siteleaf - these might include your ‚Äòabout‚Äô page, or a ‚Äòcontact‚Äô page. See more about <a href=\"/siteleaf-for-content-managers-and-creators/#Editing-existing-pages\">how to edit existing pages here</a>.</p><h4 id=\"posts\">Posts</h4><p>As a content creator, you‚Äôre most likely to want to know about the blog. Posts are connected to the blog page on your website.</p><p><img src=\"/uploads/Screen%20Shot%20Posts.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot Posts.png\" /></p><p>If your site does not have a blog, then feel free to ignore this section. You can click on the title of the post to edit.</p><p><img src=\"/uploads/Screen%20Shot%20SEO%20Blog%20Post.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot SEO Blog Post.png\" /></p><p>When you click through to the post you‚Äôll see up at the top is the title, you can click on it to edit it. Underneath is the post‚Äôs URL, and you can change the slug by clicking on the pencil icon. A slug is the editable part of your post‚Äôs URL.</p><p>Here is the URL of the post:</p><p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/seo-with-jekyll-siteleaf/</code></p><p>This part is the slug:</p><p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/seo-with-jekyll-siteleaf/</code></p><p>Having slugs that are readable by both humans and machines is useful for SEO. Readable slugs encourage users to click on the link, because they already understand what the post is about. Also, you are signposting your post to the web crawlers. For more tips on SEO read our blog post about <a href=\"https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/seo-with-jekyll-siteleaf/\">SEO with Jekyll and Siteleaf</a>.</p><p>Underneath is all the main body content of the page. You may also see inputs for metadata beneath the main body content, these will vary depending on how your site is set up. We‚Äôll go through metadata, tags, post visibility and more in our dedicated blog post video.</p><h3 id=\"files\">Files</h3><h4 id=\"uploads\">Uploads</h4><p>Here is where your uploaded images, videos and documents live. Click here to browse or search for items uploaded to Siteleaf.</p><p><img src=\"/uploads/Screen%20Shot%20Uploads.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot Uploads.png\" /></p><p>Siteleaf supports all document types; from jpegs to pdfs and mp4s. You can also add new items here by clicking ‚ÄòUpload file‚Äô.</p><h4 id=\"site\">Site</h4><p>This is where all the data for your site‚Äôs source files live.</p><p><img src=\"/uploads/Screen%20Shot%20Site.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot Site.png\" /></p><p>As a content creator, you aren‚Äôt going to want to touch it. And, depending on your user role, you may not see it on your Siteleaf dashboard.</p><h3 id=\"users\">Users</h3><p>Here you can see who else has access to your website and what ‚Äòrole‚Äô they have.</p><p><img src=\"/uploads/Screen%20Shot%20Users.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot Users.png\" /></p><p>If you‚Äôre on a Team, Business, or Enterprise site plan, there are three different roles that users can be assigned. You can also add new users here by inputting their email address, assigning their role before pressing invite.</p><h3 id=\"roles\">Roles</h3><h4 id=\"admin\">Admin</h4><p>This role has full privileges which means that you can manage and publish all content. This role is great for people who are helping build the site, like a developer or designer. Admin allows users to upload theme files, change the site‚Äôs settings, and invite other collaborators.</p><h4 id=\"publisher\">Publisher</h4><p>This is similar to the admin role but publishers can‚Äôt access theme files or the site‚Äôs settings. Publishers can manage and publish pages, posts, and uploads, but you‚Äôre protected from accidentally breaking the site‚Äôs theme.</p><h4 id=\"writer\">Writer</h4><p>This is the most limited role on Siteleaf. A Writer can only manage their own content, and any content that a Writer creates will default to ‚Äòdraft‚Äô status. This means that a Publisher or Admin must approve a writer‚Äôs content first before publishing it. This role is great for sites with many collaborators who only need access to add content, like a blog post.</p><p>If you feel you haven‚Äôt got the right role for what you need to achieve on Siteleaf ask someone with the Admin role to change your settings.</p><h2 id=\"settings\">Settings</h2><p>Here are the details of your site‚Äôs settings.</p><p><img src=\"/uploads/Screen%20Shot%20Settings.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot Settings.png\" /></p><p>Here you can edit settings or fields your developer may have created, like social media links or SEO descriptions.
