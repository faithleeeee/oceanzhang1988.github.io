      <p>By using the Siteleaf.com web site (“Service”), or any services of Oak Studios LLC (“Siteleaf”), you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions (“Terms of Service”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its affiliates and all users who access our services through your account to these terms and conditions, in which case the terms “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity, its affiliates and users associated with it. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not accept this agreement and may not use the services.</p>

<p>Siteleaf reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service from time to time without notice. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at: <a href="https://siteleaf.com/terms">siteleaf.com/terms</a></p>

<p>Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While Siteleaf prohibits such conduct and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that Siteleaf cannot be responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Siteleaf via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account’s access to the API.
